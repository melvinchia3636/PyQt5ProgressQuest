<p align="center">A native looking version of Progress Quest - the oldest idle MMORPG</p>

## The Problem

I've been playing Progress Quest for months now but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a native version for Linux and MacOS, and if I were to run in on OS other than Windows, I would have to download the exe and execute it through Wine.

## The Solution

So yeah, let's take the source code, translate it to Python, and make a GUI for it in PyQt5
